# Better Biome Blend ReBlend

Better Biome Blend is a Client-Side performance and bug-fix mod. It adds support for smooth, large scale, sRGB correct biome color transitions. With the mod installed you can set the "Biome Blend" setting in your video options from 0x0 to 29x29. Compared to Vanilla, this setting no longer impacts performance.

ReBlend makes 1.20+ possible in all modpacks, the only purpose.
If the creator makes a update using this update, the mod will be taken down and or archived.

The main difference is that we use LGPL v3 because of Architectury API also having it.
